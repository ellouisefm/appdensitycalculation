## Population Density per City
In CityDensity.R we computed the Population Density per CityProvince. We also exported the top 5 cities with the highest population density into a csv file.

First, we import the dataset csv files:
```sh
population = read.csv("population.csv")
region_area = read.csv("regionarea.csv")
```
